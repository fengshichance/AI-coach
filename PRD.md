Product Requirements Document (PRD)

Product Name: ALIVE Coach (AI Fitness & Lifestyle Virtual Expert)
Owner: Product Manager – Flora Feng
Version: v1.0
Last Updated: 2025-05-13

1. Objective

Build a personalized AI Fitness Coach that uses AI models to deliver adaptive fitness, nutrition, and wellness guidance based on users' bodies, goals, and rhythm. It integrates physiological sensing, habit tracking, and AI-driven coaching to help users build sustainable health transformations.

2. Background and Motivation

Most fitness apps offer static plans and don’t adapt to users’ energy levels, menstrual cycles, stress, or schedule. Many users fall off due to lack of:

Personalized feedback
Holistic integration (sleep, weight, diet, cycle, emotion)
Adaptability and motivation
By leveraging AI (LLMs, RL, sensor fusion), we can build a virtual coach that simulates a real personal trainer — but smarter, cheaper, 24/7 available, and more integrative.
