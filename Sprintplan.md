Here’s a **1-hour focused sprint plan** for the **AI Fitness Coach (ALIVE Coach)** PRD. It’s structured to maximize deep progress in a short time using a **time-boxed, builder-friendly format**.

---

## **1-Hour Sprint Plan: AI Fitness Coach v1.0**

### **Goal**:

Lay the first functional foundation for the AI Fitness Coach MVP — either design, architecture, or feature prototype — depending on your role (PM, designer, engineer, founder).

---

### **0:00 – 0:05 (5 min) – Setup & Sprint Intention**

* **Read/recap PRD + Data Model** quickly (focus on objectives and target users).
* Set your **1-sentence sprint intention**, e.g.:
  *“By the end of this hour, I will have a working data schema + AI coaching prompt baseline.”*

---

### **0:05 – 0:20 (15 min) – Choose and Build One Core Block**

Choose **one of these sprint types**:

#### Option A. **Design Sprint** (Figma / Whimsical / Paper)

* Sketch the **user onboarding flow** (goal setting, sleep/cycle data, preference).
* Add 1-day UX mock: “What user sees on Day 1 (morning to night)”
* Highlight where AI conversation happens and how workout is shown.

#### Option B. **Tech Sprint** (SQL / Python / Firebase / GitHub)

* Create the **PostgreSQL schema** for:

  * `User`, `DailyLog`, `WorkoutSession`, `HealthMetric`
* Optionally, mock data insert for 1 dummy user

#### Option C. **AI Prompt Sprint** (Prompt engineering)

* Design 3 smart prompts for:

  * Day 1 motivational chat
  * Adjustment of workout based on mood/sleep
  * Feedback after a completed session

#### Option D. **Narrative/Story Sprint** (PM/founder vision deck)

* Write a **user story**: "Jane, 32, exhausted at work, uses ALIVE"
* Draft the 5-slide pitch:

  1. Problem
  2. Product Vision
  3. Key Use Case
  4. Market
  5. Next steps

---

### **0:20 – 0:45 (25 min) – Build or Prototype**

* Execute the block you chose:
  Example:

  * If SQL: Write actual schema
  * If Figma: Finish 3-screen wireframe
  * If Prompt: Test prompts in ChatGPT to simulate response

---

### **0:45 – 0:55 (10 min) – Review & Document**

* Screenshot or export what you built.
* Write a **1-paragraph summary**:

  * What you accomplished
  * What you’d do in next 1-hour sprint
  * Any blockers

---

### **0:55 – 1:00 (5 min) – Store + Share**

* Save to Notion, GitHub, Figma, or wherever you store progress.
* Optionally:

  * Share with a collaborator
  * Send to me for feedback
  * Use it as a base for your next sprint

---

Would you like me to create a **template (Notion / Google Doc / GitHub readme)** for repeated use? Or suggest **a stack to use for Sprint 1 (e.g., Firebase + React + OpenAI)?**
